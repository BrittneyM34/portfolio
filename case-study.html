                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    myFlix is a web application designed with the MERN stack that provides users access to information
                    about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account,
                    update their personal information, and save a list of favorite movies.
                </p>

                <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
                <p>
                    This project was built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my
                    mastery of full stack JacaScript development.
                </p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    The aim of this project was to build a complete server side and client side web application from
                    scratch to include in my professional portfolio.

                <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database on
                    MongoDB. The API can be accessed using commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. CRUD methods are
                    used to retrieve and store data in the database. The API provides information about movies using a
                    JSON format.
                </p>

                <br>
                <p>
                    I used Postman to test the API. I included user authentication and authorization code in the form of
                    basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.

                <h2>Client-Side</h2>
                <p>
                    After completing the API, I started to build the interface that users would need when making
                    requests to, and responses from the server-side. It is a responsive, single page application that
                    was developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several different interface views including a
                    main view, single movie view, login view, registration view, and a profile view.

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>
                This project was my favorite but also most frustrating project. I enjoyed the accomplished feeling of
                creating an application from scratch, but if was a very big learning curve. I initially struggled a lot
                with the server-side of the application, but once I was able to wrap my head around what exactly the
                purpose was, I was able to more easily figure out what I was doing. The client-side was more rewarding
                for me to visual see the application coming to life.

            <h2>Duration</h2>
            <p>
                The duration of server-side took me longer as expected because I had to keep reaching out to my tutor
                for help as I kept getting stuck on certain parts. It took me some extra time to grasp the concepts but
                after some time I was able to figure it all out.
