                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>
                    myFlix is a web application designed with the MERN stack that provides users access to information
                    about movies, directors, and genres. Users are able to create an account,
                    update their personal information, and save a list of favorite movies.
                </p>

                <h2>Purpose and Context</h2>
                <p>
                    This project highlights the skills and achievements of Brittney Kouns, a MERN stack developer. It
                    was built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my
                    mastery of full stack JacaScript development.
                </p>
                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p> The objective of the application was to create a
                    user-friendly web app that catered to movie enthusiasts, providing access to movie information,
                    director details, and genre categorizations. The scope encompassed developing a RESTful API using
                    Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Password, creating a responsive SPA using React and React
                    Bootstrap.

                <h3>Server-Side</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, that interacts with a non-relational database on
                    MongoDB. The API can be accessed using commonly used HTTP methods like GET or POST. CRUD methods are
                    used to retrieve and store data in the database. The API provides information about movies using a
                    JSON format.
                </p>
                <br>

                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I used Postman to test the API. I included user authentication and authorization code in the form of
                    basic HTTP authentication and JWT authentication.

                <h3>Client-Side</h3>
                <p>
                    After completing the API, I started to build the interface that users would need when making
                    requests to, and responses from the server-side. It is a responsive, single page application that
                    was developed with React and React-Redux. It provides several different interface views including a
                    main view(shows a list of all movies), single movie view(shows data about a single movie and allows
                    users to add/delete movies from their favorites list), login view, registration view, and a profile
                    view(where users can update their user data and list of favorite movies).

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was my favorite but also most frustrating project. I enjoyed the accomplished feeling
                    of
                    creating an application from scratch, but if was a very big learning curve. I initially struggled a
                    lot
                    with the server-side of the application, but once I was able to wrap my head around what exactly the
                    purpose was, I was able to more easily figure out what I was doing. The client-side was more
                    rewarding
                    for me to visual see the application coming to life.

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>
                    The server-side took longer than expected due to initial unfamiliarity with backend concepts.
                    However,
                    overcoming these hurdles boosted my understanding of full-stack development, reinforcing my skills
                    in
                    API development and responsive design.

                    Successfully developed and deployed a full-stack application that is now a cornerstone of my
                    professional portfolio, demonstrating my ability to deliver complex projects from concept to
                    completion.

                    This project not only strengthened my technical skills but also improved my problem-solving
                    abilities,
                    preparing me for more advanced development roles. It reinforced my passion for creating user-centric
                    applications and confirmed my path towards becoming a full-stack web developer.
